    <h1>Appraise (Int)</h1>

        <a name="TOC-Appraise-Value-of-Item"></a>Appraise Value of Item</h4>
    <p>A DC 20 Appraise check determines the value of a common item. If you succeed by 5 or more, you also determine if the
        item has magic properties, although this success does not grant knowledge of the magic item’s abilities. If you fail
        the check by less than 5, you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this
        check by 5 or more, the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion. Particularly rare or exotic items might
        increase the DC of this check by 5 or more.</p>
    <p>You can also use this check to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The DC of this check is
        generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large hoard.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Appraising an item takes 1 standard action.&nbsp;Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard&nbsp;takes
        1 full-round action.</p>

        <b>About This Section</b> Optionally, a character who reaches 5, 10, 15, or 20 ranks in a skill unlocks various bonuses
        and abilities unique to that skill. The unchained rogue uses these rules extensively, but others can gain access
        to them with a new feat.</p>
    <p>In this system, characters unlock additional abilities when they attain 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. The skill

    <p>Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill.
        Any character with the
        <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the revised version

        you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and
        flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes
        such as the investigator and

    <p>An item is worth only what someone will pay for it. To an art collector, a canvas covered in daubs of random paint may
        be a masterpiece; a priestess might believe a weathered jawbone is a holy relic of a saint. The rules presented here
        offer you a way of playing through the process of selling off goods brought up from a crypt, liberated from a baron&#8217;s
        bedchamber, or plundered from a dragon&#8217;s vault. They also enable players to establish contacts with local fences,
        launderers, antiquarians, and obsessive collectors.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="TOC-Valuation"></a>Valuation</h3>
    <p>The
        <a href="appraise">Appraise</a> skill allows a character to accurately value an object. However, the fine arts of the jeweler, antiquarian,
        and bibliophile are complex. Valuable paintings may be concealed by grime, and books of incredible rarity may be
        bound in tattered leather covers. Because failure means an inaccurate estimate, the GM should attempt this skill
        check in secret.</p>
    <p>In general, a character can sell an item for half its listed price. This keeps players from getting bogged down in bargaining
        with NPCs over 10 gp on a 10,000 gp item, and maintains game balance by not allowing players to use bargaining to
        exceed the Wealth by Level guidelines by buying low and selling high. The &#8220;sell for half &#8221; rule allows
        a fair price for standard items in normal circumstances.</p>
    <p>For rare or unique items, or in certain cases, the GM might allow or encourage bargaining. Keep in mind that bargaining
        usually involves one PC talking with an NPC while the other players wait, and watching someone else bargain is rarely
        interesting. Bargaining should be infrequent, and should happen only when it&#8217;s important to the story.</p>
    <p>By using the rules for bargaining, you give up some control over your PC&#8217;s decisions and accept the risk of the
        deal falling through to gain the chance of getting a better price.</p>
    <h4>
        <a name="TOC-Step-1:-Seller-Sets-the-Asking-Price"></a>Step 1: Seller Sets the Asking Price</h4>
    <p>The seller suggests a price to the buyer. If the Asking Price is more than 150% of the item&#8217;s actual value, the
        buyer simply refuses to bargain. The lowest amount the seller will accept is 75% of this Asking Price.</p>
    <h4>
        <a name="TOC-Step-2:-Evaluate-Item"></a>Step 2: Evaluate Item</h4>
    <p>The buyer chooses to attempt either an Appraise check to estimate the item&#8217;s value or a
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check opposed by the seller&#8217;s
        <a href="bluff">Bluff</a> check (with failure meaning the buyer believes the seller is being fair). If the seller&#8217;s price is
        the same as the buyer&#8217;s estimation of the item&#8217;s value, no
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check is needed and the buyer believes the seller.</p>
    <p>A group of items can be sold as a unit. If the buyer is dealing with a mix of items she can appraise and others she can
        only guess about, she uses either Appraise or
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>, depending on which she has more skill ranks in.</p>
    <p>The GM can allow a PC to substitute an appropriate
        <a href="knowledge">Knowledge</a> skill for Appraise or
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>, such as
        <a href="knowledge">Knowledge</a> (arcana) for selling a rare book about magic. He may also assign modifiers to skill checks to reflect
        expertise or ignorance about a specific type of item, good roleplaying, or insulting behavior toward an NPC buyer
        or seller.</p>
    <h4>
        <a name="TOC-Step-3:-Determine-Undercut"></a>Step 3: Determine Undercut</h4>
    <p>The Undercut Percentage is a portion of the item&#8217;s price or value used to determine the buyer&#8217;s Initial and
        Final Offers.</p>
    <p>To determine the Undercut Percentage, have the buyer attempt a
        <a href="bluff">Bluff</a> check opposed by the seller&#8217;s
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check. The Undercut Percentage is 2%, plus 1% for every point by which the
        <a href="bluff">Bluff</a> check exceeds the
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check (minimum 0%).</p>
    <h4>
        <a name="TOC-Step-4:-Set-Offers"></a>Step 4: Set Offers</h4>
    <p>The Initial Offer is the buyer&#8217;s first counteroffer to the seller&#8217;s Asking Price. The Final Offer is the
        largest amount the buyer is willing to pay. Though the seller and buyer negotiate back and forth, the buyer won&#8217;t
        exceed this offer. For example, if the seller&#8217;s Asking Price is 1,000 gp, the buyer&#8217;s Initial Offer may
        be 800 gp and the Final Offer 900 gp. These offers are determined by how much the buyer thinks the item is worth
        compared to the seller&#8217;s Asking Price.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Fair (Appraise or
                <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>)</b>: If the seller&#8217;s Asking Price is less than or equal to the amount that the buyer
            thinks the item is worth, subtract the Undercut Percentage from the seller&#8217;s price to get the Final Offer,
            and subtract 2 × the Undercut Percentage to get the Initial Offer.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Unfair (Appraise)</b>: If the result of the buyer&#8217;s Appraise check leads her to believe the item is worth
            less than the seller&#8217;s Asking Price, subtract the Undercut Percentage from the buyer&#8217;s estimate of
            the item&#8217;s value to get the Final Offer, and subtract 2 × the Undercut Percentage to get the Initial Offer.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Unfair (
                <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a>)</b>: If the result of the buyer&#8217;s Appraise check leads her to believe the seller&#8217;s
            Asking Price is too high, subtract 2 × the Undercut Percentage from the seller&#8217;s Asking Price to get the
            Final Offer, and subtract 4 × the Undercut Percentage to get the Initial Offer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        <a name="TOC-Step-5:-Bargain"></a>Step 5: Bargain</h4>
    <p>The buyer begins bargaining by countering the seller&#8217;s price with her Initial Offer. This step repeats until the
        buyer and seller agree on a price or one side ends negotiations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Counteroffer Is Less Than Final Offer</b>: If the seller counters with a price that is less than the buyer&#8217;s
            Final Offer, have the seller attempt a Diplomacy check (DC 15 + the buyer&#8217;s
            <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier). Success means the buyer accepts the seller&#8217;s counteroffer and buys the item. Failure
            means the buyer holds at her Initial Offer. The seller can try again, but the Diplomacy check DC increases by
            5 unless the seller lowers his price.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Counteroffer Equals Final Offer</b>: If the seller counters with a price that is the same as the buyer&#8217;s
            Final Offer, have the seller attempt a Diplomacy check (20 + the buyer&#8217;s
            <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier). Success means the buyer accepts the seller&#8217;s counteroffer and buys the item. Failure
            means the buyer counteroffers at a price between the Initial Offer and the Final Offer. The seller can try again,
            but the Diplomacy DC increases by 5 unless the seller lowers his price.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Counteroffer Exceeds Final Offer</b>: If the seller counters with a price higher than the buyer&#8217;s Final

            Offer. Failure means the buyer holds at her Initial Offer. Failure by 5 or more means the buyer is insulted and
            lowers her offer or refuses to deal with the seller. The seller can try again, but the Diplomacy DC increases

    <h3>
        <a name="TOC-Example"></a>Example</h3>
    <p>Orshok has a jeweled idol worth 1,800 gp he mistakenly appraised at 2,000 gp. He tries to sell it to an art collector
        at an Asking Price of 2,200 gp, knowing the collector will counter with a lower price. The collector succeeds at
        her Appraise check and realizes the idol&#8217;s actual value. The collector attempts a
        <a href="bluff">Bluff</a> check against Orshok&#8217;s
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check and succeeds by 1, so her Undercut Percentage is 3% (base 2% plus 1% for exceeding the check
        by 1). Because the collector thinks the idol is worth less than Orshok&#8217;s price, her Initial Offer is 6% less
        than her estimate of the value (1,692 gp) and her Final Offer is 3% less than her estimate (1,746 gp). When she makes
        her Initial Offer, Orshok counters with a price of 2,000 gp. This is higher than the collector&#8217;s Final Offer,
        so Orshok attempts a Diplomacy check whose DC equals 25 + the buyer&#8217;s
        <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier to keep the buyer&#8217;s interest. He succeeds at the check, so the buyer counteroffers 1,740
        gp (between her Initial and Final Offers). Orshok doesn&#8217;t think the collector will go much higher, and decides
        to find another buyer.</p>
    <p>Later, Orshok tries to sell the idol to a spice merchant who finds it interesting but knows nothing about art. Orshok
        again starts with a price of 2,200 gp. The merchant&#8217;s
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check beats Orshok&#8217;s
        <a href="bluff">Bluff</a> check, so she realizes he isn&#8217;t offering a fair price. The merchant attempts a
        <a href="bluff">Bluff</a> check opposed by Orshok&#8217;s
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> check and succeeds by 4, which makes her Undercut Percentage 6% (base 2% plus 4% for exceeding the
        check by 4). The merchant&#8217;s Initial Offer is 12% less than Orshok&#8217;s price (1,936 gp), and her Final Offer
        is 6% less than Orshok&#8217;s price (2,068 gp). Orshok counters with a price of 2,000 gp. This is less than the
        merchant&#8217;s Final Offer, so Orshok attempts a Diplomacy check (DC 15 + the buyer&#8217;s
        <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-">Charisma</a> modifier). He succeeds, so the merchant accepts Orshok&#8217;s counteroffer and buys the item for 2,000
        gp.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="TOC-Collector-NPCs"></a>Collector NPCs</h3>
    <p>The GM can define a few NPCs as collectors, traders, or antiquarians interested in unusual items PCs collect after their
        adventures. If the PCs establish an amiable relationship with these collectors over time, the GM can reduce the base
        Undercut Percentage to 1% or even 0%, especially if the PCs&#8217; offerings cater to the NPCs&#8217; interests.
        Likewise, PCs may develop bad blood with one or more buyers; such buyers&#8217; Undercut Percentage may rise to 5%
        or higher, or the buyers may refuse to bargain with the PCs at all.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="TOC-Flooding-The-Market"></a>Flooding The Market</h3>
    <p>When PCs attempt to sell multiples of a durable good, the GM may lower the offered prices by 10% or more to reflect market
        saturation in that location. For example, a border town patrolled by guards with crossbows can always use more +1
        bolts, but has limited use for a wagonload of masterwork spiked chains, so the Initial and Final Offers for the spiked
        chains would be 10% lower.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="TOC-Trade-Goods"></a>Trade Goods</h3>
    <p>Trade goods are exempt from bargaining, even in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
    <h3>
        <a name="TOC-Using-Magic-to-Bargain"></a>Using Magic to Bargain</h3>
    <p>An unscrupulous character may use magic to charm or dupe buyers into accepting inflated prices. Something as simple as
        <a class="spell" href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person" style="font-style:italic">charm person</a> can alter the Diplomacy and
        <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> DCs by 5 in the spellcaster&#8217;s favor for an entire negotiation, and a specific suggestion can
        alter the result on a single roll by 10 in the caster&#8217;s favor. If the buyer later realizes that magic influenced
        the negotiation, she may refuse to deal with the spellcaster and attempt to get her money back, or at least report
        the spellcaster to the local authorities.</p>
