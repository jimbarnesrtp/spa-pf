    <h1>Linguistics (Int, Trained only)</h1>
    <p>You are skilled at working with language, in both its spoken and written forms. You can speak multiple languages, and can decipher nearly any tongue given enough time. Your skill in writing allows you to create and detect forgeries as well.</p> 
    <p>You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing. If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-" rel="nofollow">Wisdom</a> check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.)</p> 
    <p>Both the Linguistics check and (if necessary) the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-" rel="nofollow">Wisdom</a> check are made secretly by the GM, so that you can&#8217;t tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.</p>

    <p>Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person&#8217;s handwriting is needed.</p> 
    <p>The Linguistics check is made secretly, so that you&#8217;re not sure how good your forgery is. As with <a href="disguise">Disguise</a>, you don&#8217;t make a check until someone examines the work. Your Linguistics check is opposed by the Linguistics check of the person who examines the document to verify its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers if any of the conditions are listed on the table above.</p>

    <p><b>About This Section</b> Optionally, a character who reaches 5, 10, 15, or 20 ranks in a skill unlocks various bonuses and abilities unique to that skill. The unchained rogue uses these rules extensively, but others can gain access to them with a new feat.</p> 
    <p>In this system, characters unlock additional abilities when they attain 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. The skill unlocks system interfaces with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/rogue-unchained">unchained rogue</a> to make the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> the true master of skills.</p> 
    <p>Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. Any character with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the revised version of the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> who uses her rogue&#8217;s edge ability to gain skill unlocks for several of her most iconic skills. Alternatively, you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes such as the investigator and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>, particularly in comparison to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a>. Another alternative is to eliminate access to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat, limiting skill unlocks to <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> alone.</p>

     <p><b>5 Ranks</b>: You can use <a href="linguistics">Linguistics</a> instead of <a href="sense-motive">Sense Motive</a> to intercept and interpret secret messages (as the <a href="bluff">Bluff</a> skill). You gain a +1 <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus">insight bonus</a> on <a href="perception">Perception</a> and <a href="disable-device">Disable Device</a> checks to detect or <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> written magical traps.

     <p><b>10 Ranks</b>: If you succeed at a <a href="linguistics">Linguistics</a> check by at least 10 when examining writing, you can learn the precise meaning rather than general content, and you never draw false conclusions on a failed check. A successful DC 30 <a href="linguistics">Linguistics</a> check reveals the general meaning of speech, a successful DC 35 check reveals 1d4 pieces of specific information, and a successful DC 40 check reveals exact meaning.</p> 
     <p><b>15 Ranks</b>: You can decipher magical writings (as <a class="spell" href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/read-magic" style="font-style:italic">read magic</a>) by succeeding at a <a href="linguistics">Linguistics</a> check (DC = 25 + <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a>). If you identify a written magical <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a> in this way, you gain a +2 <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on <a href="disable-device">Disable Device</a> checks to <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm">disarm</a> it.</p> 
     <p><b>20 Ranks</b>: You can attempt to decipher magical or non-magical text at a rate of one page per round. If you instead spend 1 minute per page, roll twice and take the better result.</p>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p>The following information is <b>not</b> official in terms of general campaign usage. It is copied from the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety/faq" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society Organized Play FAQ section</a> because we thought it might be helpful information for a player or GM in adjudicating common problems or questions.

<p style="font-weight:bold">What does a deaf PC (or other creature) need to do in order to read lips?</p> 
<p>Any PC may learn to read lips with a rank in Linguistics as if they had learned a new language. When reading the lips of a speaking creature within 10 feet in normal lighting conditions, the reader need not make any skill checks. In situations of dim lighting, extreme distances, or to read the lips of someone trying to hide their words from the reader, the reader must make <a href="perception">Perception</a> checks (DC determined by the GM based on the situation). A lip reader may only understand spoken words in a language it knows.</p>
