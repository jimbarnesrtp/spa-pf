             <p style="font-weight:bold">Does the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken">shaken</a> condition from effects like Intimidate count as “an effect with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> descriptor” for the purpose of blocking spells with emotion components?</p> 
             <p>Yes, they do. It should say “<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear">fear</a> effect,” and for most descriptors, these wordings are sometimes used interchangeably. For instance, an ability that protects you from effects with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Charm">charm</a> descriptor would generally protect you from a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/harpy">harpy&#8217;s</a> song (which is a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Charm">charm</a> effect).</p>

           <p>You can use this skill to frighten your opponents or to get them to act in a way that benefits you. This skill includes verbal threats and displays of prowess.</p>

           <h4><a name="TOC-Coerce-Opponent"></a>Coerce Opponent</h4> 
           <p style="font-size:12px"><b>Source</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601258445/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1601258445&amp;linkId=6ed72bcd2ace3e794050b798e0c8346e" rel="nofollow" style="background-color:transparent" target="_blank">PPC:SpyHB</a></p> 
           <p>Sometimes you need to cow someone into submission for more than just a few hours.</p> 
           <p><b>Action</b>: Coercing a target into acting friendly for hours takes 1d4 × 10 minutes. Coercing a target into acting friendly for days requires you to successfully use coercion at least once per week for 1d6 weeks without failing any <a href="intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks against the target during that time.</p> 
           <p><b>Try Again</b>: You can’t attempt long-term coercion against the same target again for 1 week.</p> 
           <p><b>Check</b>: By spending more time threatening or harassing a target, you can attempt to force a creature to act friendly toward you for 1d6 hours + 1 hour for every 5 points by which you exceed the DC. If you succeed at such a check against the same target at least once per week for 1d6 weeks (without ever failing any <a href="intimidate">Intimidate</a> checks against the target during that time), the duration of the coercion increases to 2d8 days. Coercion is overt, not subtle, and in most cases using coercion against a creature is an evil act.</p> 
           <p>A coerced target acts as though friendly toward you even when you aren’t around, but the aid offered remains grudging at best. The target’s true attitude is hostile, and if the target believes it can take an action to hinder you that can’t be traced back to it, it’s likely to take such opportunities.</p> 
           <p>Creatures attempting to enlist its aid against you can often do so by convincing the target they are able to protect it from your wrath, using the normal <a href="diplomacy">Diplomacy</a> rules.</p> 
           <h4><a name="TOC-Demoralize-Opponent"></a>Demoralize Opponent</h4> 
           <p>You can use this skill to cause an opponent to become <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken" rel="nofollow">shaken</a> for a number of rounds. This <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken" rel="nofollow">shaken</a> condition doesn’t stack with other <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken" rel="nofollow">shaken</a> conditions to make an affected creature frightened. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> modifier.</p> 
           <div style="margin-left:40px"> 
            <p><i>Success</i>: If you are successful, the target is <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken" rel="nofollow">shaken</a> for one round. This duration increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC. You can only threaten an&nbsp;opponent this way if it is within 30 feet&nbsp;and can clearly see and hear you.&nbsp;Using demoralize on the same creature only extends the&nbsp;<span style="font-size:medium">duration; it does not create a stronger fear condition. &nbsp;</span></p>

           <p>You can use Intimidate to force an opponent to act friendly toward you for 1d6 × 10 minutes with a successful check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-">Wisdom</a> modifier.</p> 
           <div style="margin-left:40px">

            <p>After the intimidate expires, the target treats you as unfriendly and may report you to local authorities.</p>

           <p><b>About This Section</b> Optionally, a character who reaches 5, 10, 15, or 20 ranks in a skill unlocks various bonuses and abilities unique to that skill. The unchained rogue uses these rules extensively, but others can gain access to them with a new feat.</p> 
           <p>In this system, characters unlock additional abilities when they attain 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. The skill unlocks system interfaces with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/rogue-unchained">unchained rogue</a> to make the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> the true master of skills.</p> 
           <p>Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. Any character with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the revised version of the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> who uses her rogue&#8217;s edge ability to gain skill unlocks for several of her most iconic skills. Alternatively, you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes such as the investigator and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>, particularly in comparison to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a>. Another alternative is to eliminate access to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat, limiting skill unlocks to <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> alone.</p>
