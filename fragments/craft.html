  <h1>Craft (Int)</h1>
  <p>You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like
    <a href="knowledge">Knowledge</a>,
    <a href="perform">Perform</a>, and
    <a href="profession">Profession</a>, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own
    ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing,
    glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.</p>
  <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under
    the heading of a Profession skill.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Common-Uses"></a>Common Uses</h3>

  <h4>
    <a name="TOC-Practice-a-Trade"></a>Practice a Trade</h4>
  <p>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated
    work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft&#8217;s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained
    helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per
    day.)</p>

  <h4>
    <a name="TOC-Make-Something"></a>Make Something</h4>
  <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends
    on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long
    it takes to make a particular item. The item&#8217;s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
  <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the item&#8217;s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</li>
    <li>Find the item&#8217;s DC from
      <b>Table: Craft Skills</b>.</li>
    <li>Pay 1/3 of the item&#8217;s price for the raw material cost.</li>
    <li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week&#8217;s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check
      result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If
      the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you&#8217;ve completed the
      task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result
      × the DC doesn&#8217;t equal the price, then it represents the progress you&#8217;ve made this week. Record the result
      and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price
      of the item in silver pieces.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <b>Action</b>: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
  <ol>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <b>Retry?</b> Yes, but if you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week (or day, see below). If you miss
    by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Modifiers"></a>Modifiers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Tools</b>: All crafts require artisan&#8217;s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used,
      the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan&#8217;s tools provide a +2
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on the check.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Fabricate Spell</b>: In some cases, the
      <a class="spell" href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fabricate"
        style="font-style:italic">fabricate</a> spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still
      make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Ironwood Spell</b>: A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the
      <a class="spell"
        href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ironwood" style="font-style:italic">ironwood</a> spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</li>

      <a class="spell" href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/minor-creation"
        style="font-style:italic">minor creation</a>, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Progress by the Day</b>: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week if desired. In this case your progress
      (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</li>

  <h4>
    <a name="TOC-Create-Masterwork-Item"></a>Create Masterwork Item</h4>
  <p>You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional
    craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition
    to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or
    a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component
    and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component
    is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Action</b>: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
  <p>
    <b>Retry?</b> Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original
    raw material cost again.</p>

  <h4>
    <a name="TOC-Repair-Item"></a>Repair Item</h4>
  <p>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost
    of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item&#8217;s price.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Action</b>: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
  <p>
    <b>Retry?</b> Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original
    raw material cost again.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Other-Special-Situations-Modifiers"></a>Other Special Situations &amp; Modifiers
    <br> </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Accelerated Crafting</b> You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create
      the item more quickly (since you&#8217;ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress).
      You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Tools &amp; Equipment</b> To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you
      <b>must </b>have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials
      cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and
      maintaining an alchemist&#8217;s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the
      perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Gnome</b> A gnome receives a +2 bonus on a Craft or
      <a href="profession">Profession</a> skill of her choice.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Craft (mechanical)</b> Those who wish to construct or repair technological items use
      <a href="craft">Craft</a> (mechanical) in conjunction with technological item crafting feats. Without the Technologist feat,
      <a href="craft">Craft</a> (mechanical) can still be used to craft less advanced forms of technology such as gears, hinges, and pulleys.
      NPCs with the means of crafting technological items are extremely rare, and it is not assumed that PCs have access
      to such resources. GMs are encouraged to discuss such considerations with their players before allowing technological
      crafting into the game.</li>

    </p>
    <p>The spontaneous alchemy rules allow any characters to dedicate themselves to the art of spontaneous alchemy. Feats that
      increase one&#8217;s prowess in spontaneous alchemy make this path even more potent, allowing both professional and
      amateur alchemists to craft dozens of different alchemical items in a fraction of the time that would normally be required.
      For Your Character</p>
    <p>These optional rules provide an all-new way for characters to rapidly craft alchemical items. This subsystem requires
      the player to track the individual alchemical reagents her character has on hand, which she can combine in a variety
      of ways using different processes to create a wide selection of alchemical items. With the GM&#8217;s permission, characters
      with the
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/eschew-materials-final">Eschew Materials</a> feat can assume they have the correct reagents on hand to perform spontaneous alchemy; instead
      of tracking the quantities of each reagent owned, players can then simply track the number of gold pieces worth of
      reagents their PCs spend each time they perform an act of spontaneous alchemy. The cost to craft an item with spontaneous
      alchemy is usually 10% to 20% higher than the item&#8217;s market price.</p>
    <p>Characters versed in spontaneous alchemy can concoct alchemical items more quickly than through normal use of the
      <a
        href="craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) skill. However, instead of simply making skill checks and spending the necessary currency for unspecified
        raw materials, the character must provide specific reagents and combine them according to the recipe for the item
        she wishes to create. This allows the
        <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemist</a> to obtain results with less time and effort, but often at greater cost, because of the necessary purity
        and greater volume of reagents required by alchemical recipes.</p>
    <p>To perform spontaneous alchemy, a character must begin with the reagents and crafting tools required by the recipe of
      the item she wants to make. The reagents, crafting tools, and length of time required are noted in the recipe. Once
      the necessary time has passed, the creator attempts a
      <a href="craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) check against the DC to craft the item. If she succeeds, she completes the item. If the creator&#8217;s
      check fails, however, she risks a mishap (see Alchemical Mishaps).</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;border-bottom:solid thin">Reading Recipes</p>
    <p>Each alchemical item features a recipe at the bottom of the item stat block that details how to create the item using
      spontaneous alchemy. Every alchemical recipe adheres to the following format.</p>
    <div style="margin-left:20px">
      <p>
        <b>Recipe</b>: This lists the names and amounts of the reagents needed for spontaneous alchemy, as well as the alchemical
        process used to create the item.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Craft</b>: This specifies the DC of the
        <a href="craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) check required to complete the item. The base DC is the same whether the item is being made with
        conventional crafting techniques or spontaneous alchemy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Time</b>: This is the amount of time required to create the item using spontaneous alchemy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tools</b>: This is the tool required to perform the process (see Crafting Tools). If the creator uses an improvised
        crafting tool, she takes a –2 penalty on her
        <a href="craft">Craft</a> check.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Type</b>: This entry notes the type of alchemical item to be created—most alchemical items are either alchemical
        remedies, alchemical tools, alchemical weapons, alcohols, drugs, or poisons.</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;border-bottom:solid thin">Processes</p>
    <p>Each alchemical process listed below requires a certain length of time, and might require one or more alchemical crafting
      tools. The length of time and the crafting tools required to craft certain alchemical items might sometimes differ
      from these baselines.</p>
    <div style="margin-left:20px">
      <p>
        <b>Calcination</b>: This is the process of burning a reagent down to its essential minerals.
        <b>Time</b>: 1 hour.
        <b>Tools</b>: Crucible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ceration</b>: This process calls for adding a liquid (such as water) to a hard, dry, heated reagent to soften it.
        <b>Time</b>: 10 minutes.
        <b>Tools</b>: Crucible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Congelation</b>: Congelation increases the viscosity of a reagent by cooling it, possibly with the addition of another

      <p>
        <b>Digestion</b>: In this process, a solution is allowed to rest, usually while being heated, as particles precipitate
        out of the solution.
        <b>Time</b>: 1 day.
        <b>Tools</b>: Heat source.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Distillation</b>: A mixture is placed in a retort and heated, causing the component with the greatest volatility
        to vaporize, condense in the neck of the retort, and flow down into a second vessel.
        <b>Time</b>: 1 day.
        <b>Tools</b>: Retort.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Earth</b>: This process involves letting one or more reagents mingle with fresh earth to absorb its minerals or other
        essential properties. This process cannot be performed unless a source of fresh soil is available.
        <b>Time</b>: 10 minutes.
        <b>Tools</b>: None.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Exposure</b>: This process involves ready airflow. A recipe that requires this process cannot be performed indoors
        unless a steady air current from outdoors passes through the area (such as a current provided by large open windows
        on opposite walls).
        <b>Time</b>: 1 hour.
        <b>Tools</b>: None.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fermentation</b>: This process allows a reagent to be digested by yeast or another organism, yielding a new product.
        <b>Time</b>: 1 day.
        <b>Tools</b>: None.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Filtration</b>: This process separates one component of a mixture from another by passing the mixture through a filter
        that catches larger particles. This is sometimes made easier by adding a solvent that dissolves one component but
        not the other.
        <b>Time</b>: 10 minutes.
        <b>Tools</b>: Sieve or filter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sublimation</b>: Also known as exaltation, this process calls for a reagent to be heated to a vapor in a vessel so
        that a pure component crystallizes in the neck of the vessel.

    <p>Growing a fungal graft is similar to crafting a magic item, but requires only a specific number of ranks in
      <a href="craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) instead of an
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats">item creation</a> feat.</p>
    <p>Growing a fungal graft takes the same amount of time that creating a magic item of the same price does. During this time,
      the nascent fungus must be fertilized with expensive material components (the cost varies according to the graft),
      watered as needed, and kept safe from harm. After the required time has passed, the cultivator must succeed at a
      <a
        href="craft">Craft</a> (alchemy) check in order for the fungus graft to be properly formed. The DC of this check varies according
        to the graft. On a failure, the graft withers and the cultivator must begin anew. On a success, the fungus is ready
        to be grafted onto a target.</p>
    <p>Grafting a fungus onto a target requires a 1-hour-long surgical procedure, during which time the subject must be either
      willing or helpless. At the end of the hour, the surgeon must attempt a
      <a href="heal">Heal</a> check against the listed DC. Failure indicates that the patient&#8217;s body rejects the fungus and the fungus
      dies. Regardless of the surgery&#8217;s success, the subject takes 1d4 points of
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage">Constitution damage</a>. Although fungal grafts are not magical, some occupy a magic item slot on the body, preventing
      that slot from being used for any magic item or other graft.</p>
    <p>A fungal graft can be removed with a
      <a class="spell" href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal" style="font-style:italic">heal</a> or

    <p>Elves are skilled at crafting reagents from the flora growing in the forests of that nation, and some even know the secrets
      of infusing arrows and other ranged weapons with the alchemical properties of these plants. The most talented
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemists</a> can make such alchemical arrows on the fly, allowing them to choose and craft their ammunition as the
      situation warrants.</p>
    <p>Although the techniques of alchemical archery have been used for thousands of years, elven archers do not openly flaunt
      the virtues of this ancient craft, but neither do they purposefully obscure their alchemical methodologies. Those fellow
      archers and ranged tacticians who share adventures with archers may hope to find teachers in their elven companions,
      and indeed, some
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">fighters</a> are happy to share their methods.</p>
    <p>What follows is a sampling of alchemical arrows. Unless otherwise stated, these alchemical arrows are only effective
      for one shot, regardless of whether the shot hits its target. Though elven
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemists</a> created these formulae, any
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">alchemist</a> can use them.</p>
    <p>The listed costs are for one non-masterwork alchemical arrow; a masterwork version costs 6 gp more than the listed price.
      Unless otherwise noted, 20 arrows weigh 3 pounds.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Other Types of Ammunition</b>: While some archers prefer alchemical arrows to other missile weapons, characters can
      infuse other ammunition and thrown weapons that deal piercing damage (such as crossbow bolts, darts, and
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/ammunition/ammunition-thrown-shuriken">shuriken</a>) with alchemical effects. Aside from differing base statistics, these alternative types of alchemical
      ammunition have effects identical to the alchemical arrows listed here. However,
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment-final/firearms">firearm</a> ammunition can&#8217;t be imbued with alchemical ingredients, nor can ammunition types that don&#8217;t

        it deals damage as normal, but at the beginning of your next turn, the arrow bursts into flames and deals 1d6 points
        of fire damage to the target.</p>

  <h3>Making Craft Work [Alternative Crafting Rules]</h3>
  <p>Many believe that the standard rules for the Craft skill don&#8217;t work very well nor make much sense. The following
    alternative crafting rules first appeared in Making Craft Work, by Spes Magna Games.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Overview"></a>Overview</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</li>
    <li>Find the DC on
      <b>Table: Craft Skills</b>.</li>
    <li>Pay one-third of the item’s price for the cost of raw materials.</li>
    <li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work.</li>
    <li>If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in silver
      pieces, then you have completed the item
      <sup style="font-size:10px">
        <a href="#1" title="If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner. Rules presented under Exceptional Craft Checks replace this.">1</a>
      </sup>.</li>
    <li>If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches
    the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
  <p>What seems like a pretty straightforward series of steps actually produces some bizarre results. Let&#8217;s look at a
    few examples.</p>
  <div>

    <h4 style="border-bottom:solid thin">
      <a name="TOC-Examples..."></a>Examples&#8230;</h4>
    <p>
      <b>#1</b> Erlic wants to craft a one-pound silver ball. His brother Rynook wants to craft a one-pound gold ball. A one-pound
      ball of silver is worth onetenth as much as a pound of gold. Even though Erlic and Rynook work on pretty much the same
      project &#8212; melting metal and pouring it into a mold &#8212; Rynook must spend much longer on his one-pound ball
      simply because it&#8217;s made of gold.</p>
    <p>
      <b>#2</b> Erlic next wants to craft some full plate. Full plate costs 15,000 silver pieces and faces an armorsmithing
      DC of 19. Erlic has Craft (armorsmithing) +8. Let&#8217;s be unrealistic and say that he rolls a 20 for each and every
      Craft check. 28 times 19 equals 532, which means it&#8217;ll take Erlic 28 weeks to finish his full plate. So much
      for having time to adventure.</p>
    <p>
      <b>#3</b> Erlic and Rynook want to see who can craft an item first. Erlic decides to make a high-quality box (value 20
      silver pieces, Craft DC 15).</p>
    <p>Rynook wants to make a crowbar (value 20 silver pieces, Craft DC 10).</p>
    <p>The brothers have only a +1 bonus for their checks as they are both untrained when making these particular items. Again,
      let&#8217;s assume they both roll nothing but 20s. Here are the contest&#8217;s results:</p>
    <p>
      <i>* Erlic</i>: 21 times 15 equals 315, which is 15.75 times higher than the box&#8217;s cost.</p>
    <p>
      <i>* Rynook</i>: 21 times 10 equals 210, which is 10.5 times higher than the crowbar&#8217;s cost.</p>
    <p>
      <b>The Winner</b>: Erlic, despite the fact he is making the more complicated item.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Every Craft attempt is defined by two elements: the time required and the DC. The time required to craft an item is influenced
    not by an item&#8217;s price in silver pieces, but rather by its complexity. The DC is likewise influenced by item complexity.</p>

  <h4>
    <a name="TOC-Item-Complexity"></a>Item Complexity</h4>
  <p>The complexity categories listed on the table above require some defining. Keep in mind that there is a certain amount
    of subjectivity at work here. The key to item complexity isn&#8217;t to rely an exhaustive list of what items belong
    to which categories. Instead, these rules provide basic category descriptions and a few examples of sorts of items one
    might expect to fit each respective category.</p>
  <div style="margin-left:40px">
    <p>
      <b>Very Simple</b>: These items are more or less all one piece or one material of simple shape with no moving parts.
      <b>Examples</b>: crowbar,
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Simple</b>: A simple item is largely made of one material, but it requires a more specialized shape.
      <b>Examples</b>: many simple weapons,
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/containers-bags-boxes-more#TOC-Backpack">backpack</a>, most common articles of clothing, simple traps such as pits.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Moderate</b>: Moderate complexity items are characterized by diverse materials or different parts that must be integrated
      into a whole.
      <b>Examples</b>: Most martial and exotic weapons, bows, all shields, locks, simple traps using simple mechanical triggers,
      acid.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Complex</b>: Complex items have diverse materials, moving parts, different parts, and/or decorative bits.
      <b>Examples</b>: Most types of armor, strength bows, crossbows, most vehicles (excluding large ocean-going vessels),

    <p>
      <b>Very Complex</b>: These are the most complicated items. They require diverse materials, moving parts, different parts,
      decorated bits, and/or multiple functions or uses.
      <b>Examples</b>: ocean-going vessels, unusual armors (such as
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/animals-animal-gear#TOC-Barding">barding</a>), antitoxins, tanglefoot bags, sunrods, thunderstones.</p>

  <h4>
    <a name="TOC-Time-Unit"></a>Time Unit</h4>
  <p>The amount of time in this columns indicates how much time must be spent working before a Craft check is permitted.</p>

  <h4>
    <a name="TOC-DC-Modifier"></a>DC Modifier</h4>
  <p>The number in this column is added to a base DC 10 of all Craft checks.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Crafting-Masterwork-Items"></a>Crafting Masterwork Items</h3>
  <p>A masterwork item has a 50% increase in time unit (in addition to the normal increase in cost). For example, a
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> is a moderately complex item with a time unit of 2 days. Thus, a masterwork
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> has a time unit of 3 days.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, any masterwork item has its Craft DC increased by +4. Thus, the masterwork
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> faces a DC 18 Craft check
    <sup style="font-size:10px">

  <p>A craftsman working with an unusual material (such as
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a>) faces a 50% increase in time unit, which stacks with the 50% increase in time unit associated with masterwork
    items when applicable. For example, an
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine">adamantine</a> masterwork
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> has a time unit of 4 days. Also, unusual materials are harder to work with and increase the item&#8217;s
    DC as shown below:</p>

  <p>Thus, the masterwork

    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/longsword">longsword</a> faces a DC 24 Craft check.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Using-Tools-or-Not...-"></a>Using Tools (or Not&#8230;)</h3>
  <p>All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made
    with a -2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2
    <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on the check.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Failing-a-Check"></a>Failing a Check</h3>
  <p>What happens if the Craft check fails? Well, that depends on how badly it failed. When confronted with a failed Craft check,
    there are up to three possible bad effects:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If the Craft check fails, the item is not completed. Work for another time unit and try again.</li>
    <li>If the Craft check fails by 5 or more, half of the raw materials are ruined. Pay half the raw materials cost to replace
      the ruined materials.</li>
    <li>If the Craft check fails by 10 or more and you are using Craft (alchemy), your laboratory explodes. Pay to replace it
      as well as the ruined raw materials (as number 2 above). Also make a DC 10
      <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex">Reflex</a> save to avoid 1d6 points of fire damage.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Exceptional-Craft-Check-Results"></a>Exceptional Craft Check Results</h3>
  <p>What happens if you really ace the Craft check? Can a character get finished more quickly than the time unit? Certainly,
    but there are limits. For every 5 points greater than the item&#8217;s DC is the Craft check, halve the item&#8217;s
    time unit, but no time unit can be halved this way more than twice.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="TOC-Taking-the-Bizarre-Out-of-Those-Examples"></a>Taking the Bizarre Out of Those Examples</h3>
  <p>Here&#8217;s how the revised Craft system works:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Determine the complexity of the item to be made. As always, the DM&#8217;s input here may be decisive.</li>
    <li>Pay one-third of the item&#8217;s cost, including masterwork and unusual materials increases, in order to acquire necessary
      raw materials.</li>
    <li>Make a Craft check. If successful, the item is completed in the item&#8217;s time unit.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Let&#8217;s go back and look at our oddities again, but this time we&#8217;ll use the amended Craft system: Erlic wants
    to craft a one-pound silver ball. Rynook wants to craft a one-pound gold ball. Both items are very simple. They thus
    have a time unit of 4 hours and face a DC 10 Craft check. Assuming their respective Craft checks succeed, both finish
    their one-pound balls in the same amount of time (but not for the same price, since gold costs more than silver).</p>
  <p>Erlic wants to Craft some full plate. Full plate is complex. It has a time unit of 4 days and faces a Craft DC of 18. With
    a good enough Craft check, Erlic finishes his armor in 4 days and has plenty of time to go adventuring
    <sup style="font-size:10px">
      <a href="#3" title="Yes, this is unrealistic. No one finishes a suit of full plate in four days. The goal of this system, however, isn't realism, but usability.">3</a>
    </sup>.</p>
  <p>Erlic and Rynook are twin craftsmen engaged in a contest to see who can craft an item the quickest. Erlic crafts a high-quality
    box (moderate complexity, 2 day time unit, DC 14), and Rynook crafts a crowbar (very simple, 4 hours time unit, DC 10).
    Unless Rynook is incredibly unlucky with his skill checks, he&#8217;ll win the contest.</p>
  <p>There you have it. A change to Craft that makes the skill more player-friendly as well as a bit more in line with common
    sense. If it seems as if DCs are too low, just adjust the modifiers. If it seems time units are too short, lengthen them.
    The basic system itself remains intact even with such tweaks.</p>
  <p style="font-size:12px">
    <sup style="font-size:10px">1</sup>
    <a name="1"></a> If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the
    task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner. Rules presented
    under Exceptional Craft Checks replace this.</p>
  <p style="font-size:12px">
    <sup style="font-size:10px">2</sup>
    <a name="2"></a> These rules replace those for crafting masterwork items described under the Craft skill.</p>

    <a name="3"></a> Yes, this is unrealistic. No one finishes a suit of full plate in four days. The goal of this system, however, isn&#8217;t
