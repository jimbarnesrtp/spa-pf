    <h1>Perform (Cha)</h1>
    <p>You are skilled at one form of entertainment, from singing to acting to playing an instrument. Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks.</p> 
    <p>Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small sample of which is provided for each category below.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Act (comedy, drama, pantomime)</li> 
     <li>Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)</li> 
     <li>Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)</li> 
     <li>Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)</li> 
     <li>Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)</li> 
     <li>Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)</li> 
     <li>String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)</li> 
     <li>Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, trumpet)</li> 
     <li>Sing (ballad, chant, melody)</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>You can impress audiences with your talent and skill in your chosen performance type.</p> 
    <h3><a name="TOC-Action"></a>Action</h3> 
    <p>Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening&#8217;s work to a full day&#8217;s performance. The bard&#8217;s special Perform-based abilities are described in that class&#8217;s description.</p> 
    <p><b>Retry?</b> Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don&#8217;t negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)</p> 
    <h3><a name="TOC-Modifiers"></a>Modifiers</h3> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>Equipment</b> A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on all Perform checks that involve its use.</li> 
     <li><b>Trained</b> A bard must have ranks in specific Perform categories to use some of his <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance" rel="nofollow">Bardic Performance</a> abilities.</li>

    <p style="font-size:12px"><b>Source</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257155/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601257155&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;linkId=SUELYCMD4O5LZ3U6" target="_blank" title="Pathfinder Unchained">PFU</a></p> 
    <p>Optionally, a character who reaches 5, 10, 15, or 20 ranks in a skill unlocks various bonuses and abilities unique to that skill. The unchained rogue uses these rules extensively, but others can gain access to them with a new feat.</p> 
    <p>In this system, characters unlock additional abilities when they attain 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. The skill unlocks system interfaces with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/rogue-unchained">unchained rogue</a> to make the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> the true master of skills.</p> 
    <p>Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. Any character with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the revised version of the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> who uses her rogue&#8217;s edge ability to gain skill unlocks for several of her most iconic skills. Alternatively, you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes such as the investigator and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>, particularly in comparison to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a>. Another alternative is to eliminate access to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat, limiting skill unlocks to <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> alone.</p> 
    <a name="Unchained-Skill-Unlock"></a> 
    <p>With sufficient ranks in <a href="perform">Perform</a>, you earn the following.</p> 
    <div style="margin-left:20px"> 
     <p><b>5 Ranks</b>: Whenever you attempt a <a href="bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, Handle Animal, or <a href="intimidate">Intimidate</a> check, you can attempt a DC 20 <a href="perform">Perform</a> check to gain a +2 <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus">circumstance bonus</a> on the check.</p>

     <p><b>15 Ranks</b>: Whenever you cast a spell with the emotion or <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Language-Dependent">language-dependent descriptor</a>, you can attempt a DC 30 <a href="perform">Perform</a> check to increase your <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level">caster level</a> by 1. You must choose whether to use this ability or the ability unlocked at 10 ranks when casting the spell.</p> 
     <p><b>20 Ranks</b>: Choose one of the following skills: <a href="bluff">Bluff</a>, <a href="diplomacy">Diplomacy</a>, or <a href="intimidate">Intimidate</a>. When you attempt a skill check with that skill, you can also attempt a <a href="perform">Perform</a> check and use the better result to determine the success of that skill check.</p>
