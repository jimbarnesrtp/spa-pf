  <h3><a name="TOC-Common-Uses"></a>Common Uses</h3> 
  <h4><a name="TOC-Disarm-Trap-or-Device"></a>Disarm Trap or Device</h4> 
  <p>When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you’ve succeeded.</p> 
  <p>The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs.</p> 
  <p>If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a>, you spring it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p> 
  <p><b>Special</b> A <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> who beats a trap&#8217;s DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her companions) without disarming it.</p> 
  <p><b>Retry?</b> You can retry checks made to disable traps if you miss the check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you fail in order to try again.</p> 
  <h4><a name="TOC-Sabotage-Mechanical-Item"></a>Sabotage Mechanical Item</h4> 
  <p>You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use</p> 
  <h4><a name="TOC-Open-a-Lock"></a>Open a Lock</h4> 
  <p>The DC to open a lock depends on the lock&#8217;s quality: <b>simple</b> (DC 20), <b>average</b> (DC 25), <b>good</b> (DC 30), or <b>superior</b> (DC 40).</p> 
  <p><b>Modifiers</b>: If you do not have a set of thieves’ tools, these DCs increase by 10.</p> 
  <p><b>Retry?</b> Yes. You can retry checks made to open locks.</p>

  <h3><a name="TOC-Action"></a>Action</h3> 
  <p>The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><b>Simple Device</b>: Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>.</li> 
   <li><b>Complex/Intricate Device</b>: An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds. Attempting to open a lock is a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions">full-round action</a>.</li>

  <p>Characters with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Trapfinding">trapfinding</a> class feature can disarm magic traps. A magic <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a> generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.</p>

  <p style="font-size:12px"><b>Source</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257155/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601257155&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;linkId=SUELYCMD4O5LZ3U6" target="_blank" title="Pathfinder Unchained">PFU</a></p> 
  <p><b>About This Section</b> Optionally, a character who reaches 5, 10, 15, or 20 ranks in a skill unlocks various bonuses and abilities unique to that skill. The unchained rogue uses these rules extensively, but others can gain access to them with a new feat.</p> 
  <p>In this system, characters unlock additional abilities when they attain 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. The skill unlocks system interfaces with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/rogue-unchained">unchained rogue</a> to make the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> the true master of skills.</p> 
  <p>Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. Any character with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the revised version of the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> who uses her rogue&#8217;s edge ability to gain skill unlocks for several of her most iconic skills. Alternatively, you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes such as the investigator and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>, particularly in comparison to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a>. Another alternative is to eliminate access to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat, limiting skill unlocks to <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> alone.</p> 
  <p>With sufficient ranks in Disable Device, you earn the following.</p> 
  <a name="Unchained-Skill-Unlock"></a> 
  <div style="margin-left:20px"> 
   <p><b>5 Ranks</b>: Reduce the time required to disarm a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a> or open a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Lock">lock</a> by taking a –5 penalty on your Disable Device check for each step by which you reduce the time required: 2d4 rounds, 1d4 rounds, 1 round, a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions">standard action</a>, a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions">move action</a>, a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions">swift action</a>.</p> 
   <p><b>10 Ranks</b>: You can disarm magical traps at a –10 penalty even if you lack the trapfinding ability. If you possess the trapfinding ability, when attempting to disable magic traps, you never trigger them, even if you perform the trigger action (such as looking at a symbol). If you fail the check, you can still trigger the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a>, and you can&#8217;t use this ability to bypass it.</p> 
   <p><b>15 Ranks</b>: When attacked by a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a>, you can attempt a Disable Device check as an <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a> (adding your trap sense bonus, if any) opposed by the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll">attack roll</a> or its save DC. If you succeed, you take half damage (or no damage if you exceed the DC by at least 10).</p> 
   <p><b>20 Ranks</b>: You halve the penalties for performing a quick disarm as described in the 5 Ranks entry. If you possess the trapfinding ability and accept a –20 penalty while using the ability unlocked at 15 ranks, all nearby allies gain the benefit, and you disable the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a> as an <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions">immediate action</a> before it can trigger if you exceed the DC by at least 10.</p> 
  </div> 
  <h3><a name="TOC-Explosives"></a>Explosives</h3> 
  <p>With the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/technologist">Technologist feat</a>, a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> can use Disable Device to interact safely with explosive devices and disable technological devices and traps.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><b>Arm Explosive</b>: If you possess a detonator, you can arm an explosive weapon as a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a>. Connecting a detonator to an explosive requires a successful DC 10 Disable Device check. Failure means that the attempt fails, but you can attempt to arm the explosive again. Failure by 5 or more means the explosive is triggered as the detonator is installed. You can attempt to make an explosive difficult to disarm. To do so, choose a target disarm DC of 15 or higher, with a DC increment of 5. This becomes your target DC to set the explosive as well as the DC to disarm the explosive.</li> 
   <li><b>Disable Electronic Device or Trigger</b>: Disabling an electronic lock on a door or an electronic trigger for a trap (not the trap itself ) is easier if you use an e-pick—without an e-pick, you take a –5 penalty on such checks. <span style="font-size:12px"><b>Note</b>: The text of this use has been updated per official errata. [<a href="http://paizo.com/download/pathfinder/PZO9272-Errata.zip" target="_blank">Source</a>]</span></li> 
   <li><b>Disarm Explosive</b>: Disarming an explosive requires the character to succeed at a Disable Device check as if disarming a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a>. The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the explosive successfully did so with a higher disarm DC. A failure to disarm an explosive by 5 or more immediately triggers the explosive.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><b>Special</b>: A character can take 10 when using Disable Device to arm or disarm explosives, but cannot <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20">take 20</a>.</p> 
  <p><b>Time</b>: Arming an explosive device takes 1 minute or more, depending on the scope of the job. Disarming an explosive is treated as if the explosive were a complex <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps">trap</a>, and takes 2d4 rounds to attempt.</p>
