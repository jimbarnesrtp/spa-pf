    <h1>Profession (Wis, Trained only)</h1>
    <p>You are skilled at a specific job. Like <a href="craft">Craft</a>, <a href="knowledge">Knowledge</a>, and <a href="perform">Perform</a>, Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. The most common Profession skills are architect, baker, barrister, brewer, butcher, clerk, cook, courtesan, driver, engineer, farmer, fisherman, gambler, gardener, herbalist, innkeeper, librarian, merchant, midwife, miller, miner, porter, sailor, scribe, shepherd, stable master, soldier, tanner, trapper, and woodcutter.</p>

    <h4><a name="TOC-Earn-a-Living"></a>Earn a Living</h4> 
    <p>You can earn half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession&#8217;s daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems. You can also answer questions about your Profession. Basic questions are DC 10, while more complex questions are DC 15 or higher.</p> 
    <h3><a name="TOC-Action"></a>Action</h3> 
    <p>Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.</p> 
    <p><b>Retry?</b> Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.</p> 
    <h3><a name="TOC-Untrained"></a>Untrained</h3> 
    <p>Untrained laborers and assistants (that is, characters without any ranks in Profession) earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.</p>

    <p style="font-size:12px"><b>Source</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257155/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601257155&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&amp;linkId=SUELYCMD4O5LZ3U6" target="_blank" title="Pathfinder Unchained">PFU</a></p> 
    <p><b>About This Section</b> Optionally, a character who reaches 5, 10, 15, or 20 ranks in a skill unlocks various bonuses and abilities unique to that skill. The unchained rogue uses these rules extensively, but others can gain access to them with a new feat.</p> 
    <p>In this system, characters unlock additional abilities when they attain 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. The skill unlocks system interfaces with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/unchained-classes/rogue-unchained">unchained rogue</a> to make the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> the true master of skills.</p> 
    <p>Skill unlocks give characters new abilities and ways to use their skills upon reaching 5, 10, 15, and 20 ranks in a skill. Any character with the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat can earn skill unlocks for a single skill, and they are a prime feature of the revised version of the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a> who uses her rogue&#8217;s edge ability to gain skill unlocks for several of her most iconic skills. Alternatively, you might make skill unlocks a universal part of the game, but you should be aware they add significant power and flexibility to skills, so giving them for free to all classes would grant power boosts to other highly skilled classes such as the investigator and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">bard</a>, particularly in comparison to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogue</a>. Another alternative is to eliminate access to the <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-skill-general">Signature Skill</a> feat, limiting skill unlocks to <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> and <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">rogues</a> alone.</p>

    <p>With sufficient ranks in Profession, you earn the following.</p> 
    <div style="margin-left:20px"> 
     <p><b>5 Ranks</b>: When using Profession checks to earn income, you earn gold pieces equal to the result of your check each week.</p> 
     <p><b>10 Ranks</b>: When attempting Profession checks, you can roll twice and take the better result. When answering questions about your Profession, you can always take 10.</p> 
     <p><b>15 Ranks</b>: You can attempt checks to earn income once per day instead of once per week.</p> 
     <p><b>20 Ranks</b>: When attempting Profession checks, you can choose to roll once instead of twice. If you do and the result of the roll is less than 10, replace it with 10. When answering questions about your Profession, you can always <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20">take 20</a>.</p>
